## 🏗️ How It Works  
1. **User Prompting** – The program requests:  
   - **First Name**  
   - **Middle Name** (optional)  
   - **Last Name**  
   - **Prefix** (e.g., Dr., Mr., Ms.)  
   - **Suffix** (e.g., Jr., III, PhD)  

2. **Processing the Input** – The `NameFormatter` class structures the name into various formats.  

3. **Formatted Outputs** – The program generates and displays:  
   - **Full Formal Name** → Prefix, First, Middle, Last, Suffix  
   - **Standard Full Name** → First, Middle, Last, Suffix  
   - **Shortened Name** → First and Last Name only  

4. **Displaying the Results** – The formatted names are printed to the console for immediate use.
